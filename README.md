Chatbot Application
Purpose:
This Node.js application serves as a chatbot powered by Google's Generative AI. It allows users to interact with the AI model through a command-line interface, providing a question-and-answer experience.

Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
A Google Cloud Platform project with an API key enabled for the Generative AI API.

Installation:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url your-project-name
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:
cd your-project-name
npm install

Configuration:
Replace API key: In the index.js file, replace the placeholder API key with your actual Google Cloud Platform API key.

Usage:
Run the application: node index.js
Interact with the chatbot: Enter your questions in the command line prompt, and the chatbot will provide responses based on the AI model's understanding.

Customization:
Model: You can experiment with different Generative AI models by modifying the model property in the generationConfig object.
Generation parameters: Adjust the temperature, topP, topK, and maxOutputTokens values in the generationConfig object to control the AI's creativity and response length.
History: The history array can be used to store previous interactions, allowing the chatbot to maintain context and provide more relevant responses.

Additional Notes:
For more complex chatbot interactions or web-based interfaces, consider integrating this code with a frontend framework like React or Vue.
Be mindful of API usage limits and costs when using the Google Generative AI API.
Refer to Google's official documentation for detailed information on the Generative AI API and its capabilities.
